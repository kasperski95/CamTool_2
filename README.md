# CamTool_2
This app allows to animate camera in Assetto Corsa.

Version from racedepartment have included icons

The app is not optimized (10 fps drop) and the code is quite messy. 

This app reads data directly from a memory.
Everytime Assetto Corsa is updated, I have to find pointers and generate DLL file used by stdlib64/CamToolTool.py.
